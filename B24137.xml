            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>loving to have prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usinence</hi> in the Church of God, <hi>prated</hi> against the Bishops <hi>with malicious words:</hi> perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were the <hi>Successours</hi> of those <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> whom <hi>Diotrephes</hi> baited and reviled in the last <hi>Surviver.</hi> But their Disciples <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent herewith, neither</hi> themselves <hi>receive them</hi> with such honour as they ought to doe, <hi>but forbid them that would;</hi> and for as much as in them is, <hi>cast them out of the Church,</hi> as an intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable <hi>burden</hi> not imposed by CHRIST, and therefore not consistent with our <hi>Christian libertie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This as it then did put the <hi>Church</hi> to a necessitie of vindicating and asserting that forme of <hi>government,</hi> which had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
<pb facs="tcp:197735:4"/> to her with the <hi>Faith</hi> it selfe: so that necessitie continuing stil, or rather being againe obtruded on her by unquiet spirits, she is inforced to pursue her former courses, in labouring to give <hi>satisfaction</hi> to a kinde of men, who are resolved, I feare, not to be <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</hi> A labour which might well be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at this present time, if they who bring no <hi>new</hi> supply of <hi>Arguments</hi> to make good their cause, would rest content with such <hi>Old an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,</hi> as have beene given already to their <hi>Predecessours.</hi> For did men looke into this businesse with a diligent and carefull eye, it might bee easily discerned, that there hath beene no <hi>new objection</hi> made in those late dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses which have beene writ upon this Subject, but what are either <hi>Answered</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> in the learned workes of B. <hi>Bilson,</hi> B. <hi>Downham,</hi> and other worthies of this Church, now in blisse with God. But being it is the disposition of some men, not to let any thing remaine in peace, though never so well grounded, so securely settled, as long as by <hi>new</hi> furbushing their rusty Armour, they can pretend some <hi>new abilities,</hi> and therewithall <hi>new hopes</hi> to effect their purpose: it cannot but concerne the <hi>Church,</hi> and the friends thereof, to have recourse unto her publike <hi>Magazines,</hi> and thence to borrow such provision both of <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>weapons,</hi> as are therein laid up and treasured, for her just
<pb facs="tcp:197735:5"/> defence. <hi>Vt jugulent homines,</hi> is a friendly watch word, a preserving <hi>Caveat,</hi> and as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed in the title of a booke, writ by that worthy Baronet, Sir <hi>Tho. Aston.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, as long as the <hi>assault</hi> was onely made by <hi>scurrillous</hi> and unlearned <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> or <hi>emptie</hi> and unworthy <hi>Pamplets,</hi> there was no better <hi>Answer</hi> to bee given then <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> and <hi>silence;</hi> as being neither <hi>considerable</hi> for the <hi>Authors,</hi> nor <hi>formidable</hi> for the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> which might thence ensue. Nay, they occasioned by that course, as the cause was handled, no small advantage to the <hi>Church:</hi> a learned and religious Gentleman collecting out of all their scattered Papers, a full <hi>survey of the inconveniences of the</hi> Presbyterian Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, <hi>and the inconsistencie thereof with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of this state:</hi> adding therto, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their shame, and his owne great honour, out of Authenticall and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, the originall <hi>institution, succession, and jurisdiction of the antient and venerable Order of Bishops.</hi> This the best course that could bee taken possibly to detect their follies. They which went other wayes to worke, and undertooke to answer them upon <hi>equall termes,</hi> parted for ought I can see on the same <hi>termes</hi> also, complying with them in some points of no small importance, out of a silly hope to obtaine the rest: and thereby letting them perceive how much was to bee got by
<pb facs="tcp:197735:5"/> confident and continuall clamour. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of a conceit, that to bestow a dash upon the <hi>Prelacie,</hi> would make the businesse tast the better; or that they held it an high point of Policie not to goe so farre, but that they might retire with <hi>safetie</hi> in the change of times: some of these <hi>Answerers</hi> have laid as deepe a <hi>Calumnie</hi> upon the <hi>Clergie,</hi> for<note n="*" place="margin">Modest Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis. p. 19.</note>
               <hi>hunting after secular employments,</hi> for having greater care of <hi>rites and ceremonies,</hi> as of <hi>piety and godlinesse,</hi> and ordering matters of the Church, not <hi>by rule and Canon,</hi> but in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary way, as any of the <hi>Pamphleters</hi> either old or new. As if there were no better way to justifie the <hi>government</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> then by traducing of their persons, nor any safer meanes to bee devised for <hi>vindicating</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> then by <hi>calumniating</hi> the <hi>Clergie.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. For my proceeding in this matter, that must next be knowne. And that I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of in another <hi>Method,</hi> then what hath formerly beene followed. Not in the way of <hi>Argument,</hi> or of <hi>Polemicall discourse,</hi> much lesse in answer unto those with whom the <hi>Reverend Remonstrant</hi> had to doe; (I found no likelihood of any end in such disputations) but in the way of an <hi>historicall narration,</hi> as in point of <hi>fact;</hi> in which the <hi>Affirmative</hi> being made good by sufficient evidence, it will bee very difficult, if not impossible, to prove the <hi>negative.</hi> And for the better making good of the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> I have called in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient writers, the <hi>holy Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to testifie unto the truth of what here is said, either as writing on those texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> in which the <hi>institution</hi> and <hi>authoritie</hi> of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> is most cleerely evidenced; or speaking of the <hi>condition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in their severall times, in the <hi>administration</hi> and <hi>government</hi> whereof they had most of them some espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall interesse. Their testimonies and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities I have fully pondered, and alledged as
<pb facs="tcp:197735:7"/> fully; not misreporting any of them in their words or meaning, according to the best of my understanding: as knowing well, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seene experience of it, that such <hi>false shifts,</hi> are like <hi>hot waters,</hi> which howsoever they may serve for a present <hi>pang,</hi> doe in the end destroy the stomack. And for these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and renowned Authors thus by mee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, I desire no more, but that we yeeld as much <hi>authoritie</hi> unto them in <hi>expounding Scripture,</hi> as we would doe to any of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Writers on the like occasion: and that we would not give lesse credit to their <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,</hi> speaking of things that hapned in their owne times, and were within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of their observation, then wee would doe to any honest Countrey <hi>Yeoman,</hi> speaking his knowledge at the <hi>Barre,</hi> between man &amp; man. And finally that in relating such occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of holy <hi>Church,</hi> as hapned in the times before them, we thinke them worthy of as much beliefe, as we would give to <hi>Livie, Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> or <hi>Suetonius,</hi> reporting the affaires of the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> from the traditions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of the former times. This is the least wee can afford them. And if I can obtain but this, I doubt not but it will appeare most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to an indifferent and impartial <hi>Reader,</hi> first that our <hi>Lord</hi> &amp; <hi>Saviour</hi> JESUS CHRIST, laid the foundation of his <hi>Church</hi> in an <hi>impari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Ministers,</hi> &amp; that according unto his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:197735:7"/> the holy <hi>Apostles</hi> did the like, ordaining the three severall orders and degrees, of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> in the holy <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie:</hi> Next that the <hi>government</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> being founded thus, was propagated over all the <hi>world,</hi> with the <hi>faith</hi> it selfe, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no <hi>Nation</hi> which received the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other: and finally that in matter of <hi>authoritie</hi> and <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>purest</hi> times had rather more then lesse, then what now they have.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This is the summe of my designe, and this I hope will be made good in all particulars. In prosecution of the which my purpose was to have pursued this <hi>storie</hi> until the later times of S. <hi>Austins</hi> life, when as the <hi>Church</hi> was at her height for <hi>peace</hi> &amp; <hi>puritie.</hi> But finding that the times from <hi>Constantine</hi> til then, were quick and active, and likely to administer more store of matter then could be ordered and concocted in so short a time, as I had limited unto my selfe for dispatch hereof: I rather chose to publish what I had already finished, (in hope it might conduce to the publike good) then to detaine it from the <hi>Presse,</hi> till I had fully perfected the whole according to my first intention. Hereafter, if I find my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in this Peece accepted, and that I am thereby encouraged to performe the rest, I shall not be deficient in it, either unto the Church or my owne discharge. This that is done, as I have done it with all faith and
<pb facs="tcp:197735:8"/> candour, and layed it with like dutie and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection at the <hi>Churches feete:</hi> so with respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive care and Reverence doe I submit it to the judgement of the <hi>Christian Reader,</hi> for whose instruction in the point it was chiefly studied. And I shall heartily beseech all those who shall please to reade it, that if they meet with any thing therein, which either is lesse <hi>fitly spoken,</hi> or not <hi>cleerely evidenced,</hi> they would give me notice of it in such a <hi>charitable</hi> and a <hi>Christian</hi> way, as I may bee the <hi>better</hi> for it, and they not the <hi>worse.</hi> Which favour if they please to doe me, they shall bee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me, as an <hi>Angel of God,</hi> sent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me from the lanes of <hi>errour</hi> into the <hi>open wayes</hi> of <hi>truth.</hi> And doing these <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Offices unto one another, wee shall by Gods good leave and blessing, not onely hold <hi>the bond</hi> of externall <hi>peace,</hi> but also in due time be made partakers of <hi>the Spirit of unitie.</hi> Which blessing that the <hi>Lord</hi> would graciously bestow on his afflicted and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Church,</hi> is no small part of our <hi>devotions</hi> in the <hi>publike Liturgie:</hi> where we are taught to pray unto Almighty God, that hee <hi>would</hi> please <hi>continually to inspire</hi> his <hi>universall Church with the spirit of truth, unitie and concord, and grant that all they which doe confesse his holy Name, may agree also in the truth of his holy Word, and live in unitie and godly love.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which prayer, hee hath but little of a <hi>Christian</hi> which doth not heartily say, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                        <p>This being the number of the <hi>Disciples,</hi> it will then fall out, that as there were six <hi>Elders,</hi> for every Tribe; so here will be sixe <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> for every one of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> For those which have compared the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> which was first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> with that which was first founded by the <hi>Lord</hi> himself: resemble the <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Church to the twelve <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles;</hi> the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or <hi>Priests,</hi> unto the <hi>Seventy.</hi> Which parallell how well it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and whether it will hold or not, we shall see hereafter.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:197735:46"/> the <hi>Presbyters</hi> are so often mentioned, as if without their presence and assistance, the <hi>Apostles</hi> had beene able to determine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Some would faine have it so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, but it will not be. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was so assured of the doctrine by him delivered, as not to put it to the triall of a mortall man: and the <hi>Apostles</hi> of a spirit so infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the things of God, as not to need the counsell and assistance of inferiour persons. How many points of doctrine did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> determine without repairing to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles?</hi> how many did the <hi>Apostles</hi> preach and publish without consulting with the <hi>Presbyters?</hi> Somewhat there must be in it more than ordinary, which did occasion this conjuncture; and is briefly this. Some of the <hi>Jewes</hi> which had but newly beene initiated in the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and were yet very zealous of their ancient ceremonies,<note n="(z)" place="margin">Act. 15.1.</note> came from <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to <hi>Antiochia;</hi> and there delivered doctrines contrary unto those which <hi>Paul</hi> taught before. It seemes there were some <hi>Presbyters</hi> amongst them, for it is said, they taught the people: and they pretended too, that they did teach no other doctrine, than that which had beene authorized by the <hi>Apostles.</hi> The doctrine was, that <hi>except men would be circumcised af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of</hi> Moses, <hi>they could not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Paul</hi> might have over-ruled this case,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:197735:47"/> by his owne authority. But partly for the satisfaction of the <hi>Antiochians,</hi> and partly for the full conviction of these <hi>false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> he was content, by <hi>revelation</hi>
                           <note n="(a)" place="margin">Gal. 2.2.</note>
                           <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> to put the matter over to the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such of the <hi>Apostles</hi> as were then abiding in <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> that by their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall attestation, they might confirme his doctrine to be found, and true.

Certaine I am, when <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> though<note n="(s)" place="margin">Act. 19. v. 6</note>
                           <hi>Timothy,</hi> and others were then present with him, yet none but hee laid <hi>hands</hi> upon the twelve Disciples: And yet upon the laying on of his hands, <hi>The Holy Ghost came on them, and they spake with tongues and prophesied.</hi> Which if it were an Act of <hi>Ordination,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> thinkes<note n="(t)" place="margin">Beza Annot. in Act. <hi>19.</hi> v. <hi>1.</hi>
                           </note>, and it is likely so to be, because the Text saith, that they spake <hi>with tongues and prophesied:</hi> then have we here more <hi>Presbyters</hi> created by laying on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands onely, without helpe of others.

If <hi>Timothy</hi>
                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:197735:73"/> received those gifts which did enable him for the Holy Ministery, by laying on of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands onely, as it seemes hee did; what interest could the <hi>Presbytery</hi> challenge in that sacred Action? If hee received it joyntly from the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> what influence had Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> hands on him, more then all the rest? Assuredly Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> hands were not growne so impotent, that they needed helpe; or that hee could not give the graces of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> by laying on his owne hands onely, as he had done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. And therefore if the <hi>Presbytery</hi> did concurre herein, it was not that the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse could not bee performed without them, but either to declare the good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which they did beare unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or to expresse their joyfull approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his calling to that sacred function<note n="(y)" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.16. &amp; 1 Tim. 4.14.</note>, of whom so many Prophesies had gone out before; or finally to contribute their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and blessings, to the solemnity of so grave and great a worke. And so, I thinke, the businesse will be best made up, if <hi>Paul</hi> be suffered to enjoy the honour of giving unto <hi>Timothy,</hi> by the imposition of his hands, the gifts and graces of the Spirit; and the <hi>Presbytery</hi> be permitted not to want their share in the performance of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ceremony.

                           </note> was but foure whole yeares. And yet it doth appeare by that place in <hi>Hierome,</hi> for ought I can see, that the divisions of the people in Religion, some <hi>saying I am of Paul,</hi> and <hi>I of Apollo,</hi> and <hi>I of Cephas,</hi> every one cleaving unto him by whom he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Baptisme, were the occasion that it was decreed throughout the world, as that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith, <hi>Ut unus de Presbyteris electus, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perponeretur caeteris,</hi> that one of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters should be set over the rest, to whom the care of all the Church should apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that so the seedes of schisme might be rooted up. And from the time when <hi>Paul</hi> ordained those <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in <hi>Lystra</hi> and <hi>Iconium,</hi> and those other Churches, which was in <hi>Anno</hi> 48. according as <hi>Baronius</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates it, unto Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> returne unto <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which was in <hi>Anno</hi> 58. are but ten whole yeares. Before which time, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon his resolution to undertake that journey, and from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> he had appointed <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Churches of his owne plantation: so that the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in the largest and most liberall allowance that can be given them, will be too short a time to plead pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. Now that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ordained

Now <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his<note n="(t)" place="margin">Iren. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>
                           </note> words are these. <hi>In Mileto enim convocatis Episcopis &amp; Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris, qui erant ab Epheso &amp; reliquis proximis civitatibus, &amp;c.</hi>

                           </q> Out of which words of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> I collect thus much. First, that those <hi>Presbyters</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> called to <hi>Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> to meete him there, were not all of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> though all called from <hi>Ephesus: Ephesus</hi> being first appointed for the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz, or place of meeting: and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that amongst those <hi>Presbyters</hi> there were some whom <hi>Paul</hi> had dignified with the stile and place of <hi>Bishops:</hi> In which regard the Assembly being of a mixt condition, they are entituled by both names; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those <hi>Presbyters</hi> which had as yet no <hi>Bishops</hi> over them, having the charge and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:197735:78"/> jurisdiction of their Churches, under the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as before was said. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be one reason, why the <hi>Apostle</hi> in his speech to that assembly, makes no words of <hi>Timothy:</hi> who being present with the rest, received his charge together with them: as also why he gave the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> no particular charge, how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves before their <hi>Bishop;</hi> there being many <hi>Bishops</hi> there, which were not under the command of <hi>Timothy.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may gather thus much out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> that though wee find not in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the particular names of such as had <hi>Episcopall</hi> authority committed to them, but <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus:</hi> yet that there were some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops at that time of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who doubtlesse tooke as great a care for <hi>Thessalonica</hi> and <hi>Philippos,</hi> for <hi>Lystra</hi> and <hi>Iconium,</hi> as for <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>Ephesus.</hi> And that these two were by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> made Bishops of those places, will appeare most fully, by the concurrent testimonie of auncient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Wee now proceed unto S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to the Churches of his time, those most especially
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:197735:109"/> which he did either plant or water: who living till the end of this present <hi>Century,</hi> and being the last Surviver of that <hi>Glorious company</hi> of the Apostles, could not but see the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> in her fullest growth, in her protection, both for strength and beauty. Of this Apostle we find not any thing in Scripture, from his descent unto <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Acts 8.14.</note> when he accompanied S. <hi>Peter</hi> thither, by the appoyntment of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of that <hi>goodly fellowship,</hi> untill the writing of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> The interveening passages of his life and preaching, we must make up out of such fragments of antiquity, and records of story, as are come safe unto our hands. Where first I must needs disallow the conceit of those, who carry him I know not how to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him an inhabitant there, and taking with him to that place, the Mother of our Lord and Saviour: which must needs be, if ever it had beene at all, about the 44. yeere after Christs nativity, that being the time wherein the Apostles and Disciples were dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,<note place="margin">Acts 12.1. &amp;c.</note> upon the persecution raised by <hi>Herod.</hi> But that it was not then, nor a long time after, will appeare by this, that when <hi>Paul</hi> came to preach &amp; reside at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which was in Anno. 55. above ten yeers after, there was so little knowledge of the faith of Christ, that they had not so much as heard there <seg rend="sup">c</seg>
                           <hi>was any Holy ghost;</hi> being baptized only,<note place="margin">Acts 19.2.3.</note> as themselves confessed, <hi>unto</hi> John's <hi>baptisme.</hi> A thing which could not
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:197735:109"/> possibly be supposed, without a great deale of reproach and ignominy to this blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, had he beene here a resiant, as by some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. And after this, though we are well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his being here, yet then he could not have in houshold with him the blessed Mother of our Lord; who dyed in their account, that put it off untill the latest Anno. 48. seven years before the comming of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> And therefore I agree rather unto <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> as to the maine and matter of his negative, though not as to the reason of it.<note place="margin">Epiphan. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. 76. n. 11.</note> For where he tels us, <seg rend="sup">d</seg> that when <hi>IOHN</hi> went downe to <hi>Asia,</hi>

                           </gap>, hee tooke not the <hi>blessed Virgin</hi> with him; I hold it to be absolutely true, past contradiction. But wher he buildeth his negation upon an <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> the silence of the Scripture in it; I hold that reason to be insufficient: there being many things of undoubted verity, whereof there is no mention in the <hi>Holy</hi> Scripture. And I agree too unto <seg rend="sup">e</seg>
                           <hi>Epiphanius,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Epiph. ibid. n. 2.</note> where he tels us this, that S. <hi>Iohn's</hi> comming into <hi>Asia</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">

Into what parts the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did before command him, it is hard to say. Some likelyhood there is, that he did preach the Gospel amongst the <hi>Parthians,</hi> (some of

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:197735:125"/> government, which was begotten by it, and grew up with it. Nor is there any doubt at all, but that into what coasts soever the Lords <hi>Apostles</hi> preached the one, they also in the same did plant the other. The late discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of those parts and Countries which were unknown unto our Predecessours, make this cleare enough: there being no place nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion how remote soever, where there was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant any thing of the Christian Faith, in which there were not found as apparent footsteps of the <hi>Episcopall</hi> forme of government.

They could not else have fallen so unanimously on the selfe same project: nor had God blessed it with so flourishing and faire increase, a growth so suddaine and miraculous; had it not been a graft of his own heavenly planting.
